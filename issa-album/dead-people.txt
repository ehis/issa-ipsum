I'ma handle business
S600 big body and it's tinted, just to handle business
Percocets they got me in my feelings
I drive that Range Rover like it's rented
Hit 'em in the face, 'fore you turn state
Gotta beat the case, we gon' fuck your bae
We gon' beat her face
Walked out of Wells Fargo and ran to Chase
Hopped out a Bentley truck and jumped inside the Wraith
Young Savage, I was trappin' on the back street
All in traffic with that ratchet on the backseat
From the gutter, fake models don't attract me
Got a project bitch, she love to get nasty
I been drinkin' syrup seein' demons
Gotta keep it on me, niggas schemin'
Right pocket full of dead people
I been hangin' with the dead people
I been hangin' with the dead people
I been hangin' with the dead people
All my pockets full of dead people
I done fell in love with dead people
Bitch you gettin' uncomfortable, I don't need you
You come around the gang, we might G you
She say don't nobody fuck her like we do
You know I share everything with my people
My jewelry twinkle twinkle
Doin' donuts in the foreign while it sprinkles
You keep callin', I'm ignoring, bitch I'm single
You keep callin', bitch I'm single like a pringle
You know I'm fly like G4
Bitch you riding in a Pinto
Bitch you know your nigga lame like the Winslows
I'm 21 but you know PDE my kinfolk
I been drinkin' syrup seein' demons
Gotta keep it on me, niggas schemin'
Right pocket full of dead people
I been hangin' with the dead people
I been hangin' with the dead people
I been hangin' with the dead people
All my pockets full of dead people
I done fell in love with dead people
