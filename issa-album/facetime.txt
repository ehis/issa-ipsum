Girl you put up with that nigga? You strong
Ain't no need to play games, I'm grown
Out there cheating, man, it turn ya heart cold
She don't wanna hear the lies, it's old
Takin' shots even when it's too strong
Fuck a nigga, lick her, make her moan
Gotta get up in the mornin', she grown

Fuck the summer, girl I ball all season
She don't want me to think that she easy
But she ain't tryna make it seem like she teasin'
We just chillin' at the bar and she cheesin'
Buy a hundred shots for no reason

Brown liquor got her panties leakin'
